# CitiBikes

## Overview
For this project, we reviewed and analyzed the data from Citi Bike ride-share bicycles in New York City for the month of August. Our goal was to find trends and a data driven story in order to see if a similar business model would be successful and repeatable in Des Moines, IA.

## Results
We found many interesting points across the data that will help investors come to a decision:

## Summary
The starting locations graph, when laid across a map of New York, show many bikes being used around tourist and bar locations. Logically, commuters not willing or capable of driving cars would be a high customer base. I would like to see the hot spots of Des Moines, IA along with tourist spending information to see if we could find the best spots to set the bikes out for use. I found the Peak Hours graph to be particularly helpful, as the data suggests maintenance hours between 0200-0500 would have the least negative affect on revenue. Overall, the peak checkout time for the bikes in New York was between 0-20 minutes. So we would need to ensure that MOST of the bike commute in Des Moines can be done in a radius that would allow for that time gap. If not, we may have to rethink our pricing model in order to accomodate. I would also like to check the Des Moines city infrastructure plan to see if the city is considered 'biker friendly'. If our customers and units can't be safe with proper bike lanes and storage, we may need to consider a different location.  For the last tab of our story, we found that males are utilizing the bikes far more often than females and unspecified genders. Weekday utilization spikes during common rush hours, but weekend utilization stays relatively busy for most of the day.

I would like to check the census data for Des Moines against that of New York, and include per capita age ranges to see what kind of customer base we would be working with in Des Moines vs that of New York. Ultimately, these two cities are VERY different in population, size, culture, and tourism. So before we can make any recomendations, I'd like to dive deeper into city data and find more parellels.
